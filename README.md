An example how to receive video in Android Processing.

It is hacked together from video_receiver (http://shiffman.net/2010/11/13/streaming-video-with-udp-in-processing/) &Cambozola (http://www.charliemouse.com/code/cambozola/) 
I had to change it to work on Android

In my case, video is streamed from mjpg-streamer
